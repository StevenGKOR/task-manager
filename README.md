Task Manager is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack, which stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. The application provides a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, allowing users to add, view, update, and delete tasks.

The backend of the application is built using Node.js and Express.js, which provide a robust and scalable server-side environment. The NoSQL database MongoDB is used to store and manage the data, and the mongoose library is used to interact with the database.

On the frontend, the application uses React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, to create a responsive and dynamic interface. The UI is designed using HTML and CSS, with Axios used to communicate with the backend and update the UI in real-time.

Overall, Task Manager is a simple yet powerful application that can help users manage their daily tasks with ease. With its intuitive UI and robust backend, it provides a seamless user experience that is both efficient and effective.
